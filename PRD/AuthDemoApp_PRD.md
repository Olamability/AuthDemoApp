Title: Auth Demo App

Objective:
Demonstrate a robust authentication persistence system for React Native Expo apps, preventing route flashing on app startup.

Functional Requirements:

SecureStore stores JWT token

Splash screen displays until token is hydrated

Expo Router dynamically renders stacks based on token presence

React Query caches session

Logout clears token and redirects correctly

Non-Functional Requirements:

Fast startup, smooth transitions

Minimal UI but clear feedback for authentication state

Clean, well-documented code for PRD demonstration

Deliverables:

Expo project code on GitHub

Screens: Splash, Welcome, Home
